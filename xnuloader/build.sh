#
# The variants are separate files on purpose (review F04, playbook trap 9: feeding the phone
# loader to QEMU hangs the kernel at 616 bytes): a phone build writes only loader-phone.efi and
# never touches loader.efi, so a QEMU run cannot pick up phone macros by accident. The default
# build writes loader.efi -- the name every consumer already uses -- and drops an identical
# loader-generic.efi alias beside it that spells out what the file is.

# the build was made from, a full lower-case 40-hex value passed in by the builder as an input
# fixed outside the source, and the build manifest pairs that value with the artifact hash
# recorded after the link. The artifact hash stays out of the image: a file that contains its
# own hash changes that hash by being written. Deriving the value from git here is deliberately
# not done: on a modified tree it would name a commit the built sources do not match. The reply
# packer fits 63 characters including the four-character code (59 for the value), so a 40-hex
# commit sits well inside the limit. An unset BUILD_ID keeps its honest answer "unknown" and is
# warned about here: a test build must set it.
