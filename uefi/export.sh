# Preflight: this script writes BASE and mu-silicium.patch and then replaces
# files/, and the only tree shape whose export is complete is what apply.sh
# produces -- HEAD at BASE, upstream-file edits unstaged in the work tree,
# and the new port files present. Refuse before any replacement on anything
# else:
#  - HEAD ahead of BASE (local commits, e.g. the current annibale history):
#    BASE would record a commit upstream does not have and the patch would
#    lose everything already committed;
#  - staged changes under BootShim/ or Silicon/: mu-silicium.patch comes
#    from git diff, which records work tree versus index only, so a staged
#    edit would silently vanish from the patch; unstage it and decide on
#    purpose whether the export should carry it;
#  - a port path missing or with the wrong kind (directory vs regular
#    file): the copy step would fail or export the wrong shape.
# BASE, mu-silicium.patch and files/ are then staged in a temporary
# directory and replaced only after the whole export exists and its required
# paths verified. That bounds the window of partially written output to the
# replacement steps themselves; the three replacements are separate moves
# over several files, so this makes no multi-file atomicity claim.
# tools/test-uefi-export.py checks the refusals, the untouched overlay on
# refusal and the apply.sh-shaped success against throwaway git fixtures.
