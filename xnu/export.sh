# Save the kernel work as it is in the working tree, in the two forms apply.sh puts back:
#   patches/        the changes to Apple's files (against the tag the work sits on): one piece
#                   per changed file, named NN-<path>.patch with each / of the path spelled %,
#                   NN the line of that file in patches/series (a file per line, in the order
#                   apply.sh applies them -- git's own order, which is the paths sorted)
#   files/          the files that are not in Apple's tree, at their paths
# usage: xnu/export.sh [KERNEL-TREE]     (default: $XNU_SRC, else xnu-src/xnu-8796.121.2)
# Run it before committing whenever the kernel tree has changed. Committed or not makes no
# difference there: everything is compared with the base commit.
#
# One piece per file, so that two people changing two files no longer collide in one patch --
# the single redwood.patch that used to hold all of Apple's changes is retired by this export.
#
# The build container mounts the repository /src read-only, so running this there writes
# nothing: copy the script to a writable place (/work, /tmp), run it on the kernel tree, and
# take the patches/ and files/ it prints about back into the repository (docker cp, from the host).
