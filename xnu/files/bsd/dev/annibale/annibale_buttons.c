/*
 * The buttons of the REDMI K90 (annibale, SM8750 "sun") -- power, volume up, volume down -- as a
 * source of button records for /dev/redwood-input (sys/redwood_input.h). Only with boot-arg
 * buttons=1; every address below belongs to this phone. bsd/dev/redwood_buttons.c is the same
 * story for the POCO X5 Pro (redwood); with buttons=1 both start, and each stops at the first
 * step on the arbiter's version: that one knows version 5 of it, this one version 7.
 *
 * None of the three is a pin of the SoC. They are inputs of two of the power management chips,
 * exactly as under redwood, only newer silicon:
 *   power        KPDPWR_N of the power-on block ("PON") of the PMK8550, the always-on chip:
 *                qcom,pmk8550@0, pon_hlos@1300 (the merged device tree's line 19961), the
 *                pwrkey key of the gpio_keys node taking its interrupt <0x00 0x13 0x07 0x03>
 *                (line 9168): slave 0, function 0x13, so the peripheral is ppid 0x013.
 *   volume down  RESIN_N of the same block, interrupt <0x00 0x13 0x06 0x03> (line 9173).
 *   volume up    GPIO6 of the PM8550, pulled up; the key pulls it low: the gpio_keys node's
 *                vol-up entry says `gpios = <&pm8550_gpios 6 0>' (line 9164: phandle 0x68f is
 *                pinctrl@8800 of qcom,pm8550@1, line 21037 -- NOT a TLMM pin of the SoC), and
 *                its state key_vol_up-default says input-enable, bias-pull-up, power-source 1,
 *                function "normal" (line 21098). The pin driver gives each pad its own SPMI
 *                peripheral at reg + (pin-1)*0x100 (pinctrl-spmi-gpio.c, pmic_gpio_probe), so
 *                pad 6 lives at 0x8d00 of slave 1: ppid 0x18d.
 * The route to both chips is the SoC's PMIC arbiter, whose version 7 layout Linux reads in
 * drivers/spmi/spmi-pmic-arb.c and which bsd/dev/annibale_haptic.c first spoke to from here;
 * the windows and the channel arithmetic below are that file's.
 *
 * The button polling path only reads. Nothing is written to either chip, neither a register of a PMIC nor the
 * configuration of the pin: the PMICs make the phone's supplies, and a wrong write there can
 * switch one off. The firmware reads the same keys itself (volume down and volume up choose
 * between fastboot and recovery under it as under redwood) and has left both inputs as they are
 * needed; the driver checks that before it believes them, and where it finds something else it
 * says so and leaves that key alone. The only thing written is the command word that asks the
 * arbiter for a read.
 *
 * What a press is: the PON's "real time status" has a bit per key, set while the key is held
 * (after the block's own debouncing) -- of the split "generation 3" kind this is, whose HLOS half
 * (subtype 0x09) keeps RESIN at bit 6 and KPDPWR at bit 7 (qpnp-power-on.c, QPNP_PON_GEN3_*);
 * the GPIO's status register has the level of the pad, and the key is active low. A thread reads
 * the two registers 60 times a second, and a key has changed when two looks in a row say so. A
 * key that reads as held before it has ever been seen released is not believed (a pin that is not
 * what it was taken for must not become a volume key held down for the whole session). No
 * interrupt is used, as in redwood_buttons.c; what one would take is said at the end of that file.
 *
 * The mapping: the phone has what the iPhone X has, whose user space runs here -- a side button
 * and two volume keys, no home button. Power is the side button (REDWOOD_BUTTON_LOCK).
 *
 * The bring-up is made in steps, each said in the log before it is made. Boot-arg
 * buttons_hv_steps=N stops after the first N (buttons=1 asks for all five):
 *   1  map the arbiter and read its version             (the first access to that block)
 *   2  find the channels of the two peripherals         (reads of the arbiter's tables)
 *   3  ask each peripheral what it is                   (the first transfers on the bus)
 *   4  read how the keys' inputs are set up, and what they say now
 *   5  watch them                                       (the default)
 *
 * Register layouts: Linux drivers/spmi/spmi-pmic-arb.c (arbiter version 7), drivers/input/misc/
 * qpnp-power-on.c (the generation-3 power-on block), drivers/pinctrl/qcom/pinctrl-spmi-gpio.c
 * (the pad), and the phone's own device tree (spmi@c42d000, pon_hlos@1300, pinctrl@8800,
 * gpio_keys) -- the merged one under docs/analysis, line numbers as in its 2026-10-23 decompile.
