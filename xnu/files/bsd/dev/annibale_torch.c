/*
 * The flashlight of the REDMI K90 (annibale, SM8750 "sun"): the flash LED module of the PM8550
 * (SPMI slave 1, registers 0xee00; the device tree's qcom,flash_led@ee00 under qcom,pm8550@1,
 * line 20878 of the merged decompile, "qcom,qti-pm8350c-flash-led" -- four channels, the same
 * block family as redwood's PM8350C of bsd/dev/redwood_torch.c), with the rear flash LED on its
 * channel 0. The camera's torch and flash hang off it: the camera nodes name pm8550_torch0
 * (phandle 0x6b7, line 20945: torch, current step 12500 uA, max-current-ma 0x1f4 -- 500) and
 * pm8550_flash0 (0x6b3, line 20988: flash, same step, 500 mA for 300 ms).
 *
 * Numbers come from the vendor driver of this platform, drivers/leds/leds-qti-flash.c of
 * kernel_oneplus_sm8750 branch "sixteen" (the device tree's compatible names it), from the
 * device tree itself, and from what bsd/dev/redwood_torch.c verified register by register on
 * redwood's same-generation module: the module answers type 0x18 and subtype 0x07 at 0x04 and
 * 0x05; the torch current of Android's flashlight there was 125 mA in steps of 12.5 mA --
 * ITARGET code round(mA / 12.5) - 1 at IRESOLUTION bit 0 clear -- the module enabled by
 * FLASH_ENABLE_CONTROL = 0x80, then the channel by EN_LED_CTRL bit 0, and off in the reverse
 * order with ITARGET back to 0. The vendor driver lights a torch exactly so and, for a torch
 * only, deliberately leaves the per-channel safety timer disarmed (its flash path arms it, its
 * disable path clears its bit: leds-qti-flash.c 457-460 and 497-500): the torch is guarded in
 * software, ten times a second, on the module's own fault flags -- which is what this file does
 * too, as redwood_torch.c does.
 *
 * Writing to a PMIC is not like writing anywhere else: the PMICs make the phone's supplies. So
 * every write goes through one function that takes only this module's registers, every write is
 * read back, and any surprise ends all writing for the run; nothing at all is written unless the
 * module answered as the module, with its strobe already the software's as Android leaves it and
 * the module dark as it should be after a boot. A fault the module reports in real time while
 * nothing is lit stops the run's lighting: the registers that would clear a latched fault have
 * no write semantics in the vendor driver (it clears them by regmap through 0x18, whose effect
 * on latched status is implied and undocumented here), so this driver does not guess -- TODO
 * after the first look at a real one. Transfers go one at a time through the arbiter with the
 * buttons' and battery's readers (annibale_spmi_lock()).
 *
 * Nothing here is done unless a boot-arg asks for it:
 *
 *   torch_secs=N   the blind test: channel 0 lights at torch_ma (125 by default, Android's
 *                  torch current) for N seconds -- clamped to 1 to 5 -- then goes dark again,
 *                  every write read back. This also brings the module up for the primitives
 *                  below; without it they bring it up themselves when first asked.
 *   torch_ma=M     the current of the test and of later light, 1 to 500 (the device tree's
 *                  torch0 max-current-ma, line 20946).
 *   torch=3        instead of the test: the light for iOS until the run ends, through
 *                  /dev/redwood-torch as on redwood (level 0 to 1000 of torch_ma), on for
 *                  torch_max_s at a time at most (default 30, at most 120). With any torch=N the
 *                  loader also tells iOS the camera has a flash, which Control Center's button needs.
 *
 * Two primitives are kept for a camera driver (task L1b; the dylib's FigFlashlight is served by
 * torch=3 above): annibale_torch_low_on(mA) lights
 * channel 0 at up to the torch maximum and annibale_torch_low_off() puts it out; both fail
 * quietly once the module has said anything surprising. At the run's end (and on a panic's way
 * out) the light goes off.
 *
 * Register layouts: Linux drivers/spmi/spmi-pmic-arb.c (arbiter version 7: annibale_haptic.c's
 * windows), qcom's leds-qti-flash.c of this platform, and redwood_torch.c's verification of the
 * same module one phone older.
