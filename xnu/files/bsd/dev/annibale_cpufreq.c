/*
 * The clock of the processor cores on the REDMI K90 (annibale, SM8750). The CPUCP firmware sets the
 * cores' clocks and voltages; the operating system asks it for a performance level through SCMI's
 * performance protocol (0x13), one message at a time in a channel of shared memory, with a mailbox
 * doorbell after each. Domain 0 is the six cores of cluster 0, domain 1 the two of cluster 1 (stock
 * device tree: CPU0-5 clocks = <&scmi_perf 0>, CPU6-7 <&scmi_perf 1>); on the phone both name their
 * levels by index (attribute bit 25), and the boot loader leaves domain 1 at its slowest, 1017.6 MHz.
 *
 * Boot-arg cpufreq=2 only reports: the protocol, every domain with its levels and the level it is
 * at, how fast a chain of adds runs, and every 30 s the temperatures. cpufreq=1 runs a governor for
 * each domain with a core of ours, every TICK_MS:
 *   - the busiest of its cores decides: the slowest level that would have left it 80% busy, at once
 *     when that is faster, and only after DOWN_MS of wanting less when it is slower;
 *   - a touch keeps it at BOOST_MHZ or faster for BOOST_MS;
 *   - never faster than cpufreq_mhz=N (default CEILING_MHZ) or the sustained frequency the firmware
 *     gives (its sustained level index names another level: 4320 MHz for 4089.6);
 *   - at HOT_TENTHS on any sensor of its cluster it goes to its slowest level until under
 *     COOL_TENTHS, and without a valid reading it stays there. A sensor whose valid bit is clear
 *     stands by its last reading for TSENS_STALE_MS before it leaves the maximum, because that bit
 *     follows the sensor's own measurement cycle and not its health. These are far under the stock
 *     trips (95 C for cpu-1-*): the phone is not to get near those.
 * cpufreq=3 keeps the domain at the ceiling instead (still under the same temperature rule), to
 * compare with.
 *
 * Channel layout: Linux drivers/firmware/arm_scmi/shmem.c; doorbell: drivers/mailbox/qcom-cpucp-mbox.c
 * (TX_MBOX_CMD(chan) + 4; any value); addresses: the stock device tree (mmio-sram@0x17b4e000,
 * qcom,cpucp@0x17830000, channel 0 for "tx"). Temperature sensors: drivers/thermal/qcom/tsens-v2.c.
